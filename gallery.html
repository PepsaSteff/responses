		<p> IN REGARD TO: The Crystal Goblet</p>

		<p>In Wardes essay, typography, much like the significant features of a crystal wine glass, takes into account the necessity of a clean-looking page that is able to convey the message it is intending to. Warde compares two significant topics to the readability of type in order to support her purpose.  The first being the connection between type skills and the clunky, golden goblet versus a smooth, thin, clear crystal goblet.</p>
