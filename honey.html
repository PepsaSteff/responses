		<p> IN REGARD TO: WEB DESIGNER EXPOSING HUMANITY AND HUMOR OF THE INTERNET.</p>

		<p>John Lucas' work are the wonderful details that breaks down the person or people behind the designs. It examines power systems...the intriguing feature momentarily shifts how you interact with the contents of the page and leaves you wondering about the intentions of its creators.</p>

		<p> I enjoyed the raw style because of its opneness and its simplicity.  Its focused on the human craft behind a platforms creation.</p>
